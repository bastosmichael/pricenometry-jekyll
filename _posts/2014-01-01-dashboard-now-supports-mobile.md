title: Dashboard Now Supports Mobile
---

CES 2014 is coming up and we are looking forward as a startup to learn a ton about the industry as well as how to make our dashboard and our overall product much better.

We won't just spend the week meeting people though, we will also spend it coding as many great changes as are suggested, so in honor of being quick and nimble enough to make changes as we go, I'd like to reveal some screenshots of our attempt to integrate mobile support to our dashboard.

This is the first time we've shown the alpha version of our platform and we hope that these images will give you a glimpse into what we are building.

Aside from allowing people to handle categories, we will make a significant emphasis on search so stay tuned for more anouncements.
