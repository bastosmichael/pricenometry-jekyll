title: Alpha version of Dashboard sneak peak
---

So it's the end of CES 2014 and we had a blast, made some really interesting contacts along the way and got some great startup advice.

We spent a lot of time in our hotel room coding up the alpha version of our Dashboard when we weren't visiting booths and because we got so much done we wanted to give you guys a sneak peak of what we've built.

Keep in mind this is just our alpha version and we will be making many changes before our final launch in 2015. Our main focus will initially be on our API and then eventually the dashboard will follow.
